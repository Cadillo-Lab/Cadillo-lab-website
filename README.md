### **Step-by-Step Guide: Cadillo Lab Website**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/sanskarsri26/Cadillo-lab-website.git
     ```
     This will download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Enter the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd Cadillo-lab-website
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Make sure **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) are installed.
     - Verify installation:
       ```bash
       node -v
       npm -v
       ```
     - If not installed, download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
   - Install the project dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   - Launch the website locally:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will open the website in your default browser, typically at:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000
     ```

5. **View the Website:**
   - If the website doesnâ€™t open automatically, copy and paste the above URL into your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
