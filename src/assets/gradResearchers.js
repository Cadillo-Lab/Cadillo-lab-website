        bio: 'Mike delves deep into the realm of tropical peatland microbial ecology. His work revolves around employing bioinformatic techniques to decode the mysteries of microbial community assembly under varying nutrient conditions. An intriguing discovery from his studies has been the discernible influence of a nutrient gradient across peatlands within the Pastaza Maranon Foreland Basin, on the genetic composition of their soils. His investigations didn\'t stop there.Further exploration has unearthed novel microbial families that may play an indirect role in modulating methane emissions. When he\'s not immersed in lab, Mike rejuvenates by tending to his plants or embracing the nature of the state of Arizona has to offer.',
