            <p>
                The Cadillo lab advances research and discovery of the microbial role and contribution
                to the environment at various scales and fields. We aim to contribute to public value
                solutions for pressing environmental problems promoting environmental and social equity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our interests are diverse and include, among others, studies on the ecology of carbon
                rich ecosystems, the interactions and activity of microbes in response or as potential
                ecosystem drivers, and the genomics and evolution of microbes tracking their mechanisms
                of change and key innovations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our lab focuses on novel groups of methane-producing Archaea and interacting bacteria in
                anaerobic, high carbon-content natural or human-engineered environments. Understanding
                the ecology, genomics, and management of microbial communities will contribute to
                predictions of ecological dynamics and evolutionary patterns, predictions on greenhouse
                gas flux in ecosystems, and development of different bioenergy and environmental
                remediation applications. Indeed we seek to develop solutions to current problems built
                on a fundamental understanding of micro and microbial processes.

                The Cadillo lab has a dual affiliation between the School of Life Sciences and the
                Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology at the Biodesign Institute. This dual
                affiliation is reflected by our complementary efforts on basic and applied research.
